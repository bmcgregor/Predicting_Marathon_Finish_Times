READMME

Hello! This is a readme file for Beth McGregor's Capstone Project submitted as part of BrainStation's Data Science Diploma Program.

 The goal of the project was to identify factors that influence marathon race finish times and build a predictive model using linear regression and XGBoost models. 

The Capstone_Final_Submission folder contains the following:

- 1 readme file
- 7 Jupyter Notebooks
- Capstone Project Final Report_bmcgregor.pdf

The 7 Jupyter Notebooks are:

1_Chicago_Webscraping.ipynb
2_Berlin_Webscraping.ipynb
3_London_Webscraping.ipynb
4_Data_Cleanup_Prep.ipynb
5_Data_Amalgamation_EDA.ipynb
6a_Advanced_Modelling_London.ipynb
6b_Advanced_Modelling_Chicago.ipynb

NOTE: It is not necessary to run notebooks 1-3 as the data is available at the link below. These notebooks are included for reference. Notebooks 4-6b should be run in ordered sequence. 

The data can be found in the repository.
